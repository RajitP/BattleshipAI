# BattleshipAI
A C++ console game of Battleship allowing Human vs AI play, where the semi-intelligent AI learns to play better through ANN.

Using Artificial Neural Network to train an AI to play Battleship

The project can be run by compiling the bat_1.cpp file in a compiler, Visual Studio recommended (with BattleData.txt in the same folder as that of bat_1.cpp)
The text file "BattleData.txt" is the data file that the cpp file references to retireve
and update weights.

After opening the application, use W,A,S,D to navigate cursor.
"I" to place 5 ships. After placing ships, press "Space" to start the game. Navigate using w,a,s,d and "space" to hit desired location.
